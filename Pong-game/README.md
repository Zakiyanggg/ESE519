The main objective of this lab is to write a graphics library for the LCD. The second objective is to write a pong game. The third objective is to gain some familiarity with the NodeMCU board which has wifi capabilities. Hopefully you have gained enough confidence in yourself and your internet sleuthing skills that you can approach a new and unfamiliar microcontroller with no fear. :)
